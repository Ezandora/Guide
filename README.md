Guide
=====

How do I use it?
----------------
First, install it by running this command in KoLmafia's graphical CLI:

<pre>
git checkout https://github.com/Ezandora/Guide.git
</pre>

Once it's installed, look in the relay browser. In the upper-right, there will be a "-run script-" menu:

![Instructions](https://raw.github.com/Ezandora/Guide/master/Images/Instructions.png)

Select Guide. Guide will install itself into the window, and will automatically update as you go along.

To update the script itself, run this command in the graphical CLI:

<pre>
git update
</pre>

What does it do?
----------------
Guide.ash is a relay script which will give advice on playing the web game [Kingdom of Loathing](http://www.kingdomofloathing.com) within [KoLmafia, a third-party tool](http://kolmafia.sourceforge.net). It details how to complete quests you're on, and what resources you have available.

During an ascension, it will inform you what you need to know to complete your ascension as quickly as possible. Faxing, the daily dungeon, acquiring a wand, where to go next.

The script runs side-by-side with KOL. Leave the window open, and it'll update as you go along.

The script will inform you of many resources you have - free runaways, hipster fights, semi-rares, etc. - and ideas on what to use them on.
There is preliminary support for the florist friar and what to pull. It also works in aftercore.

Development guidelines
---------------------
The release above is a compiled version of the development version, which can be found by checking out https://github.com/Ezandora/Guide/trunk/Source/ instead. If you wish to edit the script easily, start there.
The release is compiled via Compile ASH script.rb, which collects the seventy or so scripts into one for ease of release.
Currently, the only guidelines are avoid visit_url(), as well as any connection to KOL's servers. This is meant to be a local application.

This script, as well as its support scripts, are in the public domain.
